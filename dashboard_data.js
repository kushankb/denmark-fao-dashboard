The tax aims at incentivising a reduction of on-farm emissions, and to incentivise the withdrawal of agriculture on low-lying land where agricultural productivity is low. Indirectly, it is thought this tax will incentivise improved feeding practices to reduce emissions, improved manure management, and a withdrawal of agriculture on sensitive areas where nitrogen-leaching is especially damaging the aquatic environments.

Targeted support to increase the production of specific crops or the use of chemical inputs should be phased out and replaced with less distortive interventions. In particular, support for high-GHG crops should be replaced with non-discriminatory payments and incentives towards enhanced practices (e.g. through cross compliance). Importantly, the shift in policies should promote a medium- or long-term horizon for farmers to i) recover the initial costs; ii) build the nature capital associated with these practices; iii) develop know-how; and/or iv) benefit from ecosystem services payments on a regular basis. Indeed, many CSA practices could be associated with lower profits during the first years of adoption, and policies must change to address that likelihood",

The tax aims at incentivising a reduction of on-farm emissions, and to incentivise the withdrawal of agriculture on low-lying land where agricultural productivity is low. Indirectly, it is thought this tax will incentivise improved feeding practices to reduce emissions, improved manure management, and a withdrawal of agriculture on sensitive areas where nitrogen-leaching is especially damaging the aquatic environments.

Indirectly, it is thought this tax will incentivise improved feeding practices to reduce emissions, improved manure management, and a withdrawal of agriculture on sensitive areas where nitrogen-leaching is especially damaging the aquatic environments.

For example, innovative cold storage solutions and low-scale storage options tailored for smallholders can be deployed. Investments should prioritize sustainable cooling systems powered by renewable energy to prevent spoilage without increasing emissions. Additionally, the optimal use of F-gases must be considered, as they contribute to global warming and constitute a rapidly growing source of GHG emissions due to increasing demand for cooling in response to climate-related volatility in agricultural primary production.",

The tax aims at incentivising a reduction of on-farm emissions, and to incentivise the withdrawal of agriculture on low-lying land where agricultural productivity is low. Indirectly, it is thought this tax will incentivise improved feeding practices to reduce emissions, improved manure management, and a withdrawal of agriculture on sensitive areas where nitrogen-leaching is especially damaging the aquatic environments. Proposals for the design of the tax are developed in the Green Tax Reform (2024).",

The tax aims at incentivising a reduction of on-farm emissions, and to incentivise the withdrawal of agriculture on low-lying land where agricultural productivity is low. Indirectly, it is thought this tax will incentivise improved feeding practices to reduce emissions, improved manure management, and a withdrawal of agriculture on sensitive areas where nitrogen-leaching is especially damaging the aquatic environments.

The tax aims at incentivising a reduction of on-farm emissions, and to incentivise the withdrawal of agriculture on low-lying land where agricultural productivity is low. Indirectly, it is thought this tax will incentivise improved feeding practices to reduce emissions, improved manure management, and a withdrawal of agriculture on sensitive areas where nitrogen-leaching is especially damaging the aquatic environments.

Strengthening these rights not only promotes social equity but also enables long-term investments in land stewardship. It is also important to develop the long-term valuation of soils as economic assets, including their carbon content, and to promote their use as potential collateral. This can help align economic and financial incentives with sustainable land management practices.",
